                    <em>To the Seeker of Flavors & Fortunes,<br><br>
        
                    We are the All-Knowing Golden Masters, keepers of taste, and whisperers of wisdom. 
                    For centuries, we have dwelled within the brittle shells of fortune cookies, 
                    speaking only to those who dare to break through. 
                    But the world is vast, its flavors ever-changing, and so we step forth into 
                    this new domain—to listen, to gather, to preserve the stories of taste that must not be forgotten.<br><br>
        
                    Here, within the halls of Flavors & Fortunes, you are called to share what you have savored. 
                    Speak of the meals that have graced your table, for every dish holds a tale, every bite a lesson. 
                    What pleased your tongue, what stirred the spirit, what lingers still in memory? In return, 
                    we shall bestow upon you a fortune, a whisper of insight drawn from the great unknown.<br><br>
        
                    <strong>Savor. Review. Receive Wisdom.</strong><br><br>
        
                    With endless knowledge,<br>
                    The All-Knowing Golden Masters</em>
