            <p>I have a total of four piercings on my ears, but Iâ€™ve gone through the ear-piercing experience three different times. The first time was back in third grade, after what felt like an eternity of me dramatically pleading my case (and probably annoying my mom to no end). She had originally wanted me to wait until I was much older, but after my relentless pestering, she finally gave in and took me to a nearby jewelry shop for my first ear piercings.
                The shop used a piercing gun, and like any other first-time experience, I was nervous. As I sat in the chair, I braced myself like I was about to undergo some life-changing surgeryâ€”and technically, I was, since I was about to have two new scars permanently added to my body. Would I faint from the pain? Would I walk out of here looking ten times cooler? 
                Thenâ€”<em>pop</em>. Then another <em>pop</em>. I had prepared for unbearable pain, but honestly? Getting a paper cut was worse. Within seconds, I had my first two piercingsâ€”one on each ear lobe. And just like that, I was officially a pierced person. I definitely walked out feeling ten times cooler.</p>
