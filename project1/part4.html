            <p>The last timeâ€”and hopefully the <em>final time</em>â€”I got my ear pierced was in September 2024, so yeah, pretty recently. So far, all has been well (knock on wood).
                The previous two times I got my ears pierced were at a jewelry shop, where they used a piercing gun. But this time, I thought, <em>letâ€™s go for the upgrade</em>. I went to a much more <a href="https://www.livebytheswordtattoo.com/piercings">professional location</a>â€”recommended by a friend who was basically a piercing pro at this point. Instead of the piercing gun, they used a needle, which, apparently, is the <em>superior</em> option, and they even used implant-grade hypoallergenic earrings. Yes, my ears were treated like royalty.
                In addition to getting my ears repierced, I also added two new piercings on the upper lobe. Yes, I decided that two wasnâ€™t enough, I needed four, why not torture my ears a little more. 
                But this time, I actually did all the aftercare, like a responsible adult. Saline solution? Check. Keeping the earrings in for six to eight weeks before switching them out? Double check!
                And after waiting patiently for eight weeks,  I switched out the earrings, but this time, I decided to get a little creative. I made some of my own using an earring-making kit and shrinky dinks which was a very fun experience. Now I am rocking with my own hand-made earrings.
                So, fingers crossed this is the end of the piercing journey.
