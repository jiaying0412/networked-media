            <p>The second time I got a piercing was after my middle school graduation when I went back to China during the summer with my family. I decided to have my previous two piercings repierced and I was really hoping this would be the last timeâ€”no more infections, no more disappointments. This time, I walked in with a mix of determination and mild trauma from my first attempt. But hey, I had survived third grade math, so surely, I could handle this.
                As I sat down for round two, I told myself: <em>This time, it's going to be different.</em> Maybe my ears just needed a second chance at life. Maybe I just had bad luck the first time around. The piercings went in smoothlyâ€”pop, popâ€”and I left the shop feeling victorious.
                For a while, things were looking good. This time, I broke the recordâ€”I think I went a couple of months without an ear infection. I was finally living my best accessorized life.
                And thenâ€¦ well.
                I love my life, honestly, but I guess piercings just werenâ€™t meant for me.
