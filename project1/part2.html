            <p>My first two piercings didnâ€™t last long. I ended up with an ear infection, and to this day, Iâ€™m not exactly sure why. It could have been a mix of thingsâ€”maybe because piercing guns arenâ€™t the best method for getting your <span style="text-decoration: line-through; text-decoration-thickness: 3px;">eyes</span> (ouch, typo!) <em>ears</em> pierced, maybe because I swapped out the earrings way too soon, or maybe because I wasnâ€™t exactly the best when it came to aftercare.
                But damn, having to stop wearing my earrings made me feel ten times less cool. Especially in classâ€”I could no longer show off my <em>very</em> stylish earrings. And eventually, as time passed, my piercings closed up.
                But, but, butâ€¦ this was only the beginning.
